# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch-on-Andrew-ng-s-problem
Here I have implemented logistic regression along with the analysis of cost function associated with each epoch.

# Dataset
The data used here has been taken from Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning course on Coursera. The data consists of marks of two exams for 100 applicants. The target value takes on binary values 1,0. 1 means the applicant was admitted to the university whereas 0 means the applicant didn't get an admission. The objective is to build a classifier that can predict whether an application will be admitted to the university or not.

Here I loaded the data into pandas Dataframe using the read_csv function. I also splitted the data into admitted and non-admitted to visualize the data.

Below shows the decision boundary made by logistic regression implementation.

And finally we have the change in cost with completion of each epoch.
